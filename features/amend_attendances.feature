Feature: amend_attendances

  As a admin
  So that I can amend the attendance of mentors of my school
  I want to validate an invalid checkin/out record, create a new checkin, or create a new corresponding checkout for a checkin that's missing a checkout

  Background: mentors and schools have been added to database, signed in as a super_user

    Given the following schools exist:
      | name                            | address                               | lat        | lon           |
      | Berkeley Arts Magnet School     | 2015 Virginia St, Berkeley, CA 94709  | 37.876869  | -122.270348   |


    And the following admins exist:
      | name       | email                      | school_id                    |
      | Darain     | darain@sagementorship.org  | Berkeley Arts Magnet School  |

    And the following mentors exist:
      | name      | email             | school_id                    |
      | Emma B    | emmab@berkeley.edu | Berkeley Arts Magnet School  |

    And the following checkins exist:
      | mentor_id | school_id                   | checkin_time       |checkin_lat| checkin_lon | isValid |
      | Emma B   | Berkeley Arts Magnet School | 2019-12-2 13:00:00 | 37.876869 | -122.270348 | false    |

    And I am signed in as an "admin", "Darain"


  Scenario: 1) validate an invalid checkin/out record
    Given I am on the "show_checkin, Emma B, 2019-12-2 13:00:00" page
    And I press the "Edit Check In" link
    Then I should be redirected to the "edit_checkin, Emma B, 2019-12-2 13:00:00" page
    And I choose "True" in the select box labeled "Isvalid"
    And I press the "Save" button
    Then I should have this "checkin" record:
      | mentor_id | school_id                   | checkin_time        |checkin_lat| checkin_lon | isValid |
      | Emma B    | Berkeley Arts Magnet School | 2019-12-2 13:00:00  | 37.876869 | -122.270348 | true    |


  Scenario: 2) create a new corresponding checkout for a checkin that's missing a checkout
    Given I am on the "show_checkin, Emma B, 2019-12-2 13:00:00" page
    And I press the "Create New Checkout" link
    Then I should be redirected to the "new_checkout" page
    And I pick "2019-12-2 14:00" in the datetime_select box labeled "Checkout time"
    And I press the "Save" button
    Then I should have this "checkout" record:
      | mentor_id | school_id                   | checkout_time        |checkout_lat| checkout_lon | isValid |
      | Emma B    | Berkeley Arts Magnet School | 2019-12-2 14:00:00   | 37.876869  | -122.270348  | true    |
